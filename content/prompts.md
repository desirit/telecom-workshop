## 2. Chain Prompting Examples

### Customer Support Analysis Chain

#### Step 1: Issue Classification
```
Analyze this customer support ticket and classify the issue:
1. Service type affected
2. Severity level (High/Medium/Low)
3. Technical domain (Network/Voice/Hardware)
4. Potential impact scope

Format as a concise list.

Ticket ID: INC-2024-0115-001
Priority: High
Status: Open
Customer: Enterprise Client XYZ
Service Impact: Voice Quality Issues

Description:
Customer reports intermittent voice quality issues affecting 50+ users at their main office location. Issues started approximately 2 hours ago. Users experiencing static, echo, and occasional call drops.

```

#### Step 2: Technical Analysis
```
Based on the classified issue, analyze the technical details provided:
1. List all relevant technical metrics
2. Compare metrics against standard thresholds
3. Identify any missing critical information
4. Flag any unusual patterns

Technical Details:
- VoIP Service Plan: Enterprise Voice Premium
- Connection Type: Dedicated Fiber
- Current Bandwidth: 1Gbps
- QoS Settings: Enabled
